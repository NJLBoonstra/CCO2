  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.

  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'
  `No, indeed,' said Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'
  `No, no!  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an

  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt
  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
  `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
  `No,' said the Caterpillar.
  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the

  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
  `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the

  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
  `Nothing,' said Alice.
  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on
  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree
  `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's
  `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came
  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'

  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I

  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to

  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for
  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'
  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'

  `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;
  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'
  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather

  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,
  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'
  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')
  `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
  `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.
  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she
  `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'
  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
  `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the
  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said
  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.  I never knew
  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
  `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said
  `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:
  `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'
  `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a
  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess
  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'
  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
  `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon
  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured
  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she
  `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of
  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with

  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers
  `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice
  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,
  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round
  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
  `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'
  `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went
  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to
  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and
  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but
  `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'
  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently

  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to

  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this

  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a
  `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter
  `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,
  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and
  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
  `Very much indeed,' said Alice.
  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both
